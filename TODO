=================
General

- To do things right, I really need a libsane-perl to call upon. 
  There does not seem to be such a beast however.

=================
ScanBooklet

- Allow multiple document scanning; allow input and change of 'specs.
	N - new document
	S - set document specs
  Define a default value for args.
   Query for changes
	date:
	name:
	dest:
	format:   L:XxY

	- I sometimes need to change the L/P setting during 
	  scanning so it should have a default but be
	  changeable from the CLI
	  [DMA 20070514-?]

	- add a 'j' commmand for 'job parameters' and
	  give it sub modes to modify anything I would like
	  to have modifiable in Document, Scanner, etc.
	  [DMA 20080828-?]

- allow argument files that can name specific magazines,
  like NewScientist and set up the format and such.nn

- ARCHIVES: how do I best go back and repair the .toc files
  with missing contents and other tags?
  [DMA 20070514-?]

	- I need a simple editor that can do this. Even better
	  if there are packages to let me do thumbnail images
	  in a GUI.
	  [DMA 20070514-?]

	- Perhaps add an 'e' command for edit toc?
	  [DMA 20080828-?]

- Perhaps I should have a Scanner::Config.pm file to hold defaults.
  Place it in an /etc/ directory. Or wait and have a more general
  Archivist::Config.pm file.
  [DMA 20080828-?]

	- To do it right, it should have an installer to set the
	  defaults according to user selections. I am not sure
	  how to make debian scripts and Perl work together for
	  something like this.

- SCANBOOKLET: it would be nice if uparrow restored the page type as well
  as number
  [DMA 20070514-?]

- We need lots and lots of documentation for this!

=================
scan

- It would be nice to create an X window to do this in.
  [DMA 20040817 - ?}

- I would like to set --brightness 100, but but the option shows as 'inactive'
  and I do not know how to get it activated. Possibly some other option 
  setting does that?

	- I have temporarily lost the ability to do x and y in dpi or mm, 
	  it is accepting only inches.
