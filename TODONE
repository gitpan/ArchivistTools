x Package Scanner/Job.pm
	x may want to merge Scanner, Scanner::Page and Scanner::Job
          into one package for simplicity
  (Done.)
  [DMA 20070514-20080806]

x I really need a solution to the problem of supplying args
  to this routine. Putting them on the command line will
  lead to a very long line. May be no other choice but I
  do not like it.
	x SCANBOOKLET: I need a better way to change parameters than
	  editing the file!

  (I used the P:8.5x13 format style to make it much more
   palatable. Package is now a real installed debian package.)

x Requires that Term::Readline::Gnu is installed. 
  Term::Readline will default to it if present. 
	x What if something else is present instead that has different 
	  features? Should I do Feature checks?
	x SCANBOOKLET: requires libterm-readline-gnu-perl
	  [DMA 20070514-?]
  (I have placed it as a requirement in the debian control file and
   the perl Makefile.PL)

x Bug: I cannot handle names like "Air&Space". The chdir
  Perl command fails on it.
  (I have eliminated the chdir command)

x if you select "NotAvailable" as the page source type on
  an hp scanjst adf, it fails to replace it with "Normal"
  the valid 'not adf' type.
  (I have eliminated the use of any internal types. Only
   predefined external types are allowed and they are
   internally mapped to whatever is allowed for a supported
   scanner.)
  [DMA 20070514-20080828]

x SCANBOOKLET: if a scan fails or you terminate before a scan,
  the .toc and .log may not accurately reflect the final situation.
  (I believe I have solved this, or at the very least mostly
   solved it. The log and toc are now not written if the page
   file does not exist.)
  [DMA 20070514-20080828]

x ARCHIVIST: Scanbooklet cannot escape to page number after
  being set to 000.spine!
  (I completely rewrote spine handling.)
