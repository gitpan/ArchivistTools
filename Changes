 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Sat, 30 Aug 2008 21:55:35 +0100

scanbooklet (0.01-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_perl to rules and ${perl:Depends} to control file.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Thu, 21 Aug 2008 02:08:32 +0100

scanbooklet (0.01-3) unstable; urgency=low

scanbooklet (0.01-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix. I used a wrong target variable when I parsed the page format
    width.

scanbooklet (0.01-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial packaged release.
  * Updated to handle command line options.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Thu,  7 Aug 2008 01:41:35 +0100

scan (2.0.0-5) stable; urgency=low

  * Added -d switch to allow the setting of the global $::DEBUG
    variable. At the moment this only causes a print of the
    scan command line generated in Scanner.pm.

  * Added test for minimum of 5 args. If less it prints help
    and exits.

scan (2.0.0-4) stable; urgency=low

  * Set dpi switch default to undef so that if there is no
    explicit value, the Scanner object will use the default
    value appropriate to the scanner. This was forced by
    the hp5590 which cannot scan at 150 and must instead scan
    at 200dpi.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Sun,  6 May 2007 15:52:51 +0100

scan (2.0.0-3) stable; urgency=low

  * Set scanner switch default to undef so that if there is
    no explicit value, the Scanner object will use the default
    value. This might be the $SCANNER Environment variable. The
    existance of a default at this level was overriding the
    setup in the Scanner object.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@vnl.com>  Tue,  1 May 2007 15:22:33 +0100

scan (2.0.0-2) stable; urgency=low

  * Remove erroneous perl build pre-depends from control file.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@islandone.org>  Fri,  1 Sep 2006 23:59:15 +0100

scan (2.0.0-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Rewrite to use Scanner and Scanner::Page objects. Stripped
    out the ability to use dots or mm for page dimensions. I
    might restore it in the future when I have a chance to work
    out a good way to do it via the standard objects.

scan (1.0.0-3) stable; urgency=low

  * Started signing packages again.
  * I had to handle the problem caused by changes
    to scanimage that made resolution device dependant.
    We are now back to only working with UMAX.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@islandone.org>  Mon, 28 Feb 2005 22:07:17 +0000

scan (1.0.0-2) stable; urgency=low

  * Converted from unsupported umax-cli to scanimage program, 
    found in debian umax-utils package.

 -- Dale Amon <amon@islandone.org>  Tue, 17 Aug 2004 18:39:12 +0100

scan (1.0.0-1) stable; urgency=high

  * Initial release. Simple program I wrote back in 2000.
